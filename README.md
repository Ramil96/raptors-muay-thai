## UX

### Pre-project planning
> When embarking on this project, I wanted to create a website that not only showcases the dynamic spirit of Raptors Muay Thai but also provides an accessible platform for new and existing members. I was driven by my passion for martial arts and my personal connection to Raptors Muay Thai. Having trained there for several years, I have seen firsthand the dedication and hard work of the trainers and athletes. 

I looked at the existing website of Raptors Muay Thai and started to decide wether there were any parts of the website which I wanted to keep. After spending some time analysing the website thoroughly I decided that I wanted to do a whole revamp of the site layout, carrying over very few elements such as the information regarding the classes, the logo and the timetable. I decided I wanted to enhance user experince and make it simple for potential customers to navigate through the site making it easier to join the gym. I wanted to change many elements from the old site especially contrast in colors so user readability is enhanced, pricing to be made much more clear with new content filled sections being added and higher quality images with a new modern feel to the site.

## UX Design

### Strategy Plane
---
To determine the best approach to this project, I began by identifying and understanding both user and business needs. By focusing on these needs, I could ensure that the website would be functional, user-friendly, and aligned with Raptors Muay Thai's goals.

## User Stories
### User
> As a user I want to be able to find a Muay Thai Gym in my local area to improve my fitness.

> As a user I want to be able to be able to see the prices of different memebership options.

> As a user I want to be able to read testimonials as proof of work and see evidence of the gym's training quality.

> As a user I want to be able to find out when the gym is open.

> As a user I want to be able to contact the gym online.

### Business Owner
> As the site owner I want to be able to showcase my Muay Thai gym to potential customers.

> As the site owner I want to share the history, community and background of our local gym.

> As the site owner I want to provide clear and detailed information about our class schedules, pricing, and membership options.

> As a site owner I want to show the user our gymâ€™s opening hours and include a map for clear directions to the gym.

## Scope Plane
> The website should have a navigation menu that is consistent across all pages and devices.

> The website should neatly and appropriately list the services we provide, such as Muay Thai classes for adults and children, conditioning sessions, and fitness programs.

> The website should give users proof of our success through testimonials from members and a portfolio showcasing our training sessions, events, and achievements.

> The website should make it easy for prospective members to get in touch.

> The website should include a map so users can plan their route to our gym, making it easy to find us.

> The website should display our opening hours prominently on all pages, ensuring users are always aware of when they can visit or contact us.

## Structure Plane
> To achieve the goals of the above the website will inclide at least 4 pages consisting of: Home, About, Prices and Contact Us.

#### Home Page
> Navigation with links consistent across all pages.

> Hero image with text welcomes user with a consistent weekly schedule of activity letting the user know the gym is activley keeping information up to date.

> Testimonials on the Prices page showcasing reviews and experiences through members during time spent at the gym.

> Footer section containing the necessary information regarding classes taught, opening times, contact information and location, kept consistent across all pagess.

#### About Us
> The About Us page should show a picture of two Muay Thai fighters in a ring suggesting live gym competition.

> The Abous Us page should showcase information regarding the history of the gym itself and the variety of classes taught.

#### Prices
> The Prices page should show an image of a girl at the gym with a clickable button which takes the user to a specific part of the page which shows the different membership options giving the user the ability to choose from 3 unique memberships and has the ability to sign up and register via clicking the desired membership on this page.

#### Contact Us
> The Contact Us page should have a contact form where users can place there information in the form and write a message to the gym.

## Skeleton Plane

### Home Page desktop Wireframe

![Home page wireframe](assets/images/wireframes/Wireframe%20index.PNG)
> The design flow of this website is meant to showcase a minimal design showing necessary information which is in the header.

## Surface Plane

### Color

> I decided that the best approach to this website was a structured yet minimalistic design to bring light to the most important information at the top by the header to influence direct access and information regarding location and contact information about the gym which would lead customers and website users to easilly access the website and information. To highlight this information and make the UX better I would need to stick to 3 main colors as the website prior to my creation had very hard to differentiate from background to information so instead of using dark colours I used bright colors which would contrast well with backgrounds I would be using.

> The decision I took in terms of which colors were to be used were
> - #A4161A - Blood red
> - #fff - White
> - #000 - Black


>Additional color usage was used at the bottom of the pages as the footer needed a stronger and brighter color to be able to see properly the sub headings for the items in the footer which are also clickable links so here i dimmed out the background and made the sub text even brighter for the user to see, additional color would come from images used across the website but the main color principle are the 3 most commonly used as suggested above.

### Typography 
> The font's chosen for this project were 
- Roboto
- Sans serrif

> The reason I used these two fonts were to keep the text simple and easy to read with no distractions. I wanted to make sure that I was able to assist users with visual impairments with the choice of font.
