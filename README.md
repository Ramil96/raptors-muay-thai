## UX

### Pre-project planning
> When embarking on this project, I wanted to create a website that not only showcases the dynamic spirit of Raptors Muay Thai but also provides an accessible platform for new and existing members. I was driven by my passion for martial arts and my personal connection to Raptors Muay Thai. Having trained there for several years, I have seen firsthand the dedication and hard work of the trainers and athletes. 

I looked at the existing website of Raptors Muay Thai and started to decide wether there were any parts of the website which I wanted to keep. After spending some time analysing the website thoroughly I decided that I wanted to do a whole revamp of the site layout, carrying over very few elements such as the information regarding the classes, the logo and the timetable. I decided I wanted to enhance user experince and make it simple for potential customers to navigate through the site making it easier to join the gym. I wanted to change many elements from the old site especially contrast in colors so user readability is enhanced, pricing to be made much more clear with new content filled sections being added and higher quality images with a new modern feel to the site.

## UX Design

### Strategy Plane
---
To determine the best approach to this project, I began by identifying and understanding both user and business needs. By focusing on these needs, I could ensure that the website would be functional, user-friendly, and aligned with Raptors Muay Thai's goals.
